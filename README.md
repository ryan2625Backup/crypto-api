Crypto Website in progress.


TOOD: Read/write stream for sparkline in proxy?


Edit: Hosting sparklines locally because of CORS issues - coingecko denies access to download their images via API requests

Edit 2: Routes for the trending coins are not used anymore because I switched plans on cyclic.sh. Moving the API call to the frontend.
